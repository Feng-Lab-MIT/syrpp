# syrpp

The purpose of syrpp is to provide an open-sourced solution to control syringe pumps via RS232 serial communication. More high-level features will be supported in the future.

## Compatibility

Code is tested on Braintree programmable syringe pump, which make it support only pumps that use the same set of commands. Information about their command definition can be found on [their manual](https://www.braintreesci.com/content/product_tmp_uploads/pdf/11596-man.pdf).
